- The meaning of above is
  The KeyValueBytesStoreSupplier interface is used in Apache Kafka Streams to define state stores 
that store key-value pairs. In your code snippet, you are creating a new instance of a key-value store 
named "all-transactions-store" using the Stores.persistentKeyValueStore() method. 
This indicates that you want to create a persistent key-value store, meaning that 
the data stored in this store will be durable and will survive system restarts.

Here's a breakdown of the code snippet:

1) KeyValueBytesStoreSupplier: This interface represents a supplier of KeyValueStore instances. 
It's used to create instances of key-value stores.

2) Stores.persistentKeyValueStore(): This is a static factory method provided by the Stores class 
in Kafka Streams. It's used to create a new key-value store supplier for a persistent key-value store.

3) "all-transactions-store": This is the name you've chosen for your key-value store. It's the identifier 
that will be used to refer to this store within your Kafka Streams application.

By creating this key-value store, you're setting up a durable storage mechanism where you can store and 
retrieve key-value pairs, which can be useful for maintaining state within your Kafka Streams application.

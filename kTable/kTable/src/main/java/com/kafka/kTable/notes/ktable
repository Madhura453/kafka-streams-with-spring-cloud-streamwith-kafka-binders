- There are three major types in Kafka Streams â€“ KStream, KTable and GlobalKTable.
Spring Cloud Stream supports all of them. We can easily convert the stream to the table and vice-versa.
To clarify, all Kafka topics are stored as a stream.
The difference is: when we want to consume that topic, we can either consume it as a table or a stream.
KTable takes a stream of records from a topic and reduces it down to unique entries using a key of each message.
